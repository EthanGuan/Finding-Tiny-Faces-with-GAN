# Finding-Tiny-Faces-with-GAN

This is a reimplemetation of [1].

![architecture](./asset/architecture.jpg)

It uses python3, pytorch, and tensorboadX by default.

see [experiment.ipynb](./experiment.ipynb) for discription and result visulization.

# Pretrained weight
I've uploaded Pretrained SRGAN weight file to:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wfLQCXTR9YoxiWgkVoVw9NLHo4HO-jSL

Download it and put it in a new directory:
```mkdir -p Finding-Tiny-Faces-with-GAN/models```

# Training

```python train.py```
